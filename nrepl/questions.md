# Questions

The following are some questions that might be nice to get answers to.

* Does nREPL / clojure somehow update location information for
  definitions that get "shifted" by subsequent definition evaluations
  that take place "above"?
  * Design an experiment to test this?

* Does there exist any useful language-agnostic documentation for
  nREPL somewhere?
